\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:Intro}

There is a very challenging and fundamental problem in Physics.
Now, I am explaining the problem and the approaches that have been used in order to address this problem.
These approaches are not suitable in all cases.
Now I am explaining a different approach that works in a specific set of cases.

This dissertation is organized as follows.
In Chapter~\ref{chp:background}, background material is covered.
In Chapter~\ref{chp:approach}, our approach is introduced.
Chapter~\ref{chp:results} contains results obtained from our approach.
We conclude with general remarks in Chapter~\ref{chp:summary}.
